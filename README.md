## Files:

### terminal.c

Front end terminal program (compiles to par-shell-terminal). This cli sends commands for the par-shell server to run.


### main.c

Server application launcher (compiles to par-shell). This listens for commands, executes programs, and sends messages to currently running par-shell-terminals.


### processList.[ch]

Manager library for currently running subprocesses (threadsafe)


### terminalList.[ch]

Manager library for currently connected terminals (non-threadsafe)


### commandlinereader.[ch]

Lib provided by teachers to read commands from the terminal.


### defines.h

Useful #defines to make safety checks less bulky




How to compile:
==========
Just run make:
```
  make clean
  make all
```

How to run:
===========
To start the server type:
```
% ./par-shell
```
> A abrir o pipe /tmp/par-shell-in-PmBaoW/par-shell-in para leitura...

(This pipe is unique per run (it is generated by mktemp))


Then, to start any client, just type:
```
% ./par-shell-terminal  /tmp/par-shell-in-PmBaoW/par-shell-in
```
> /home/username/SO/par-shell$


Note that we start every application with the PATH equal to the current working directory (.). So, in order to run, for instance, ls, you have to run /bin/ls instead of ls (as /bin is not on the PATH)
